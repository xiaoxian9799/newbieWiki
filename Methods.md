# Methods
aka Functions

## Declaring A Method
```
return_type name(input_parameters) // method signature
{
  method_definition
};
```

Example:
```
void SayHello();
```

`void` = the method returns no data

## Calling A Method
```
method_name(input_parameters);
```

> [!NOTE]
> C#    
> A method can be called before or after its definition.

`return` terminates execution of its method and returns control to the caller.
