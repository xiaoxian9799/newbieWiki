## Introduction <!-- 20240117 -->
- Examples of _operating system_: Microsoft Windows, Linux OS, Apple macOS, Apple iOS, Google's Android OS   
- The _interactive shell_ is good for _running or executing_ Python _instructions_ one at a time (by using >>> _prompt_), whereas _file editor_ is good to write instructions for the entire Python programs.
- Both _compiler_ and _interpreter_ translate _source code_ (that adhere to _syntax rules_) into machine code. Compiler translates code at once before the program runs, whereas interpreter translates code line-by-line as the program runs.    
- Writing programs involves breaking down a problem into individual, detailed steps.     
  
_debugging_    
_module_  

## 01 - Python Basics <!-- 20240117 -->
_Expressions_ are formed by putting _values_ and _operators_ together, and they always _evaluate_ down to a single value.    
A _data type_ is a category for values, examples: _int_, _float_, and _str_.

`SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal` means you probably forgot the final single quote character at the end of the string.

| Operators | Math Operations | String Operations |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | String concatenation |
| * | Multiplication | String replication |

_assignment statement_ `var_name = val`    
_assignment operator_ `=`

A _variable_ is _initialized or created_ the first time a value is stored in it. The variable can be _overwritten_ when it is assigned a new value.

The Python program _terminates or exits_ when there are no more lines of code to execute. The Python program _crash_ (the program stopped running unexpectedly) if they contain code the computer can't understand, which will cause Python to show an error message.

### Naming Rules for Variable
- Only one word with no spaces.
- Only letters, numbers, and `_` char.
- Cannot begin with a number.

- case-sensitive    

_comment_ `#`   
Python is _calling_ the `print() ` function and the _argument_ (i.e. string value) is being _passed_ to the function.     
The `input()` function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press ENTER.    
The `len()` function evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in a string.

The `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions evaluate to the string, integer, and floating-point forms of the value you pass, respectively.    
An integer can be equal to a floating point. Example: `42 == 42.0`
